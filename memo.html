    <h1 class="title">PEGA (Low-Code App Builder)</h1>

    Low-code development : products and/or cloud services for application development that employ visual, declarative techniques instead of programming
    - Creating software that writes your software. <br>
    Low-code development tools create the code for you. Increases productivity, simplify development. Outpaces the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.
    Bridges the gap between business stakeholders and skilled developers, creates a common visual language to collaborate more effectively, more agile => 
    explain the business logic rather than the code. Build a mobile and web-based request system with notifications for collaboration and SLA tracking. <br>
    Pega platform can be used to create very robust applications.

    <h2>Workspaces </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>App studio : </b> low-code or no-code workspace designed for citizen developers and technical staff (business analysts, 
            system architects, front-end developers, data engineers).
        Users can design cases, manage data and design the user interface. The visual model helps plan and manage team's workload. 
        Get results while saving time (add value asap), contextualize the user's needs. </li>
        <li><b>Dev studio : </b> low-code workspace with advanced configurations for technical team members (full-stack dev, database and
             security admin, SA). To go deeper into the Pega platform, more concepts than App studio (+200). Manage operators and access groups.</li>
        <li><b>Prediction studio : </b> analytics workspace used by data scientists and business decision-makers. Build machine learning 
            models. (AI, Next Best Action). </li>
        <li><b>Admin studio : </b> software administration workspace managed by IT staff for system administration (monitoring, security, 
            debug, run-time, cloud, DevOps).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Integration : Pega simplifies the connection of the application to distributed resources (ex: external databases). Graphically maps
         the data into the application for a holistic view.</p>
    
    <h2>Design system</h2>

    A builder kit = shared library of UX patterns that speeds up design and development time. <u>Constellation design system </u> to 
    build app quickly and keeps the app easy to update for future releases. Provides presentation layer that includes the information 
    architecture, interactions, accessibility, data visualizations... (other : Cosmos design system). 
    Context switching, multitasking, <u>modular design</u>, filtering, collaboration view, AI-powered collaboration tools, responsive templates...
    <p>Responsiveness : menu names and icons are displayed differently depending on the screen size. 
        ==> modular design (allow users to learn the meaning of discrete elements on the screen to be re used in multiple contexts).</p>
    Dashboard shows info without needing to scroll, adapted for any business case. <br>
    The summary panel contains critical information about the case. The size and shape are similar to a mobile device. 
    It is placed on the upper left because this is where users tend to look for context.
    The global navigation is on the far left. It is not limited to Pega-branded assets.

    <h2>Journey configurations and cases :</h2> <a href="microjourney.html">Journey</a>

    <h2>View</h2>
    A view is a component of the UI that gathers information from a user or displays information to the user. Displays the fields 
    necessary to complete the current assignment. For example, in an application the view for applicants to enter their personal info 
    is different from the view for the officer who sees applicant's information as read-only fields and who can approve or reject 
    with a field for the reason. <br>
    The view is not always a form. Views have fields, forms can have buttons.


    <h2>Multi-step forms</h2>
    A form is an interface for collecting data from users and processing the work. A form can have one or more views. When it requires a 
    lot of data, multi-step form is used to help users complete complicated tasks : presents information in multiple focused and concise 
    screens. Users can enter, save and change info as long as the screen is not submitted.
    
    <p>Draft mode allows to quickly run the case type even with incomplete configurations or errors to check the run-time behavior.
        Must be turned off before the app is released to production. It is automatically switched off when you save a case type that has 
        processes with no errors.
    </p>
    


    <h2>Data modeling</h2>
    Process by which <b>data elements</b> arrive into your application in a format that makes sense for your business (to determine
    before create the data model) and are then processed, reported on and stored.

    <h3>Data model : </h3> defines the types and structures of data in our application and standardizes how data elements relate to one another.

    <h3>Data object (= data type) : </h3> template for describing an entity (person, item, ...) by grouping a set of related fields or 
    <b> <u>data elements = field name + stored value</u> </b>.
    Key business entity, contains all the fields necessary to describe the entity.
    A field is a named, reusable UI component. It is associated a field type. (Type User Reference for a picklist of user ID).
    <p class="ex">Ex : field : name, field type : text, value : Marina. name + Marina = data element</p>
    Data objects can be re-used for several case types. Associated to a <u>data page</u>.
    
    <p><b>Data relationship</b> : a data object can contain other data objects. We can also use inheritance. </p>
    <p class="ex">Ex : the data object Candidate contains the data object Address (one-to-one) and the data object Employment history (one-to-many).
        The data object Candidate is a child of the data object Person. It contains the information of a Person (fields) plus the information necessary to 
        describe a Candidate.
    </p>


    <p> <b>single record :</b> single entity grouping related field (single set of values).</p>
    <p><b>multiple records :</b> list of entities grouping related fields.</p>

    <h3>Data pages : </h3>
    identify how to connect to the system of record and what fields to map in the data object. Provide links
    between data records and the application. The Visual data model is a diagram that shows these links : 
    relationships between data objects (one-to-one, one-to-many...). You can add, update, delete fields while viewing.
    
    <h3>Data records : </h3> provide values for the fields of a specific data object. Local data storage or external database
    but is not part of an application.
    Each record has an identifier pyGUID.

    <h3>Data storage : </h3>
    <h4>Work class : </h4> contains rules that describe how to process cases (processes, data elements, UI).

    <h4>Data class : </h4> contains rules that describe the data types in the application (customer data type, order items data type).
    Data that exists outside of data objects (to be easy to share, portable).

    <p>Use of the <b>Configure a view</b> screen to add new fields as needed. </p>

    <h4>Data type sourcing : </h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pega system of record (SOR) :</b> ex New Candidate application</li>
        <li><b>External system of record (SOR) :</b> ex HR database, the candidate data are already saved somewhere</li>
        <li><b>No system of record (SOR) :</b> ex </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Field types :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Case reference :</b> single or multiple records from a selected Case type by id</li>
        <li><b>Data reference :</b> single or multiple records from a selected data page by id (both used to show a user a list of options)</li>
        <li><b>Embedded data :</b> users-supplied data sourced from inside a case type (information provided by the user during the case)</li>
        <li><b>Query :</b> a data page or view that is not sourced from inside a case type</li>
    </ul>

    Integration designer : provides a single location in App Studio for viewing data objects, data pages, object dependencies and 
    external systems in an app.
    The Integration map is a diagram of the data objects, cases and systems of record in the app and where they are sourced.
    (visualization tool that shows the relationships between data objects, data pages and systems of record).
    
    
    <h2>Calculation</h2>
    Calculation expresses a relationship between fields by setting the value of a calculated field based on one or more input fields. 
    For instance an online shopping cart app provides a total cost for each item ordered based on unit price and quantity ordered.
    Calculation occurs when users update the value of an input field. We can create networks of dependent calculations. <br>
    It reduces mistakes by avoiding manual computations.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Functions </b>iterate over items in a list (sum of, average of, maximum of, minimum of)</li>
        <li><b>Expressions </b>calculate a field value by referencing any combination of simple and fancy fields and data relationship values (+,-,*,/,(),AND,OR)
        (ex : total cost for 2 products : price*quantity+price*quantity)</li>
        <li><b>Decision tables </b> use a set of conditions to test property values and return an appropriate response</li>
    </ul>
    Input values/fields = declare expression, result = target property

    <h2>Service-level agreement :</h2>
    <a href="SLA.html">SLA</a>

    <h2>Email correspondence</h2>
    Step "Send email". When the case reaches this step, the email is automatically sent to the selected parties.
    In configuration pane : Send to "field" "customer email" to get the email that the Customer entered in case of updates. <br>
    Send correspondence to a group of stakeholders. 
    Participants : Owner (the person who created the case), Customer (the person on whose behalf the case is transacted), 
    Interested (a person who tracks the progress of a case without processing it). <br>
    "+ compose" to write the email that will be received. Referencing fields with "<<.field_name>>". <br>
    Case-level notifications : send notifications to the user associated with the worklist. "Settings" "Notifications" checkbox
    "Email user when the assignment is routed to worklist".
