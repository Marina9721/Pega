        <li>A <b>Persona</b> is the business representation of a role/type of user. Share common application security and assignments. 
            A user is assigned a persona. When you create a new persona, Pega creates default permissions and a work queue for the persona.</li>
    </ul>
    Add a new persona : Users > User Management > Add Persona. Then assign it to users in People.
    
    <b>Channels</b> in Pega refer to the user interfaces that are used to perform tasks. The needs of different users require access to
    different application features. Channels are created before roles. <br>
