    <h2>Data manipulation</h2>

    <h3>Data transforms</h3>

    The purpose of a data transform is to manipulate data in an application. It copies or manipulates data into the fields
    that you require. Can be used to convert data from one type to antoher, iterate over page lists or data groups and copy 
    entire pages at a time.
    <p class="ex">Ex 1 : In the Payment information view, the customer provides a shipping address. If the billing address 
    is the same, to reduce potential errors, use a data transform to copy the shipping address to the billing address fields 
    instead of reentiring the info. <br>
    Ex 2 : You receive an order delivery date input from another system as a string value "March 25, 2023". Use a data 
    transform to copy and convert the stored string format of the delivery date into the date value property, 03/25/2023.
    Ex 3 : To copy data from a child case to a parent case, use a data transform to iterate over the list of possible items 
    and services and copy only those entries.
    </p>
    Functions to convert, for example string to number, in <b>Configure</b>.
    You can call a data transform from a flow (<b>Connector properties</b>).

    <h3>Default property values</h3>

    Set default values for properties that are already known to reduce the time that users spend entering data. 
    <p class="ex">Ex : in a claim case, set the default date to today's date. <br>
        Ex : In a travel booking application, fill automatically the Date of return field on the user operator record. </p>
    Default values can de edited in App Studio in <b>Data initialization</b> page in <b>Settings</b> (<i>pyDefault</i> data 
    transform for more complex default values). You can select properties to set default values and you can assign exact 
    values to each property.

    <p><b>Superclass feature</b> to make data transforms more modular. Combine several data transforms to set values at 
    multiple levels of the class hierarchy (you can set a different default value for the same property within a hierarchy 
    of subclasses).
    When the superclass feature is enabled on data transforms, at runtime, Pega :
    Identifies the parent of the current class, Identifies the next level parent until the highest parent class is located,
    Finds the data transform, Invokes data transforms. <br>
    In Dev Studio, create a data transform with the same name at each class level and ensure the <b>Call superclass data 
    transform</b> option is selected on the desired data transform. If properties are specified in both the parent and 
    subclasses, the data transform in the subclass overrides the data transform in the parent class.
    </p>


    <h2>Data in memory</h2>

    <p>
    While processing a case, data elements (field name+stored value) remain in memory for use by one or more users.
    Each one is stored in memory on a page. A <b>page</b> is a structure for organizing data elements in an app.

    </p>

    A <b>clipboard</b> is a portion of memory on server reserved py Pega for the data generated by users as they use 
    applications.
    This tool organizes and presents all the pages in memory, listing all the properties on each page and the value 
    of each property. Tool to display data in memory. To update and add properties to test features that rely on 
    data not yet added to a case (decisions, UI forms). 
    3 areas : the header (threads = single action currently managed by Pega), 
    the left (lists each page, name+class, by categorie)
    and right (lists all properties set on the selected page and their values) panes.
    <ul>
        The four categories in the left pane :
        <li><b>User Pages :</b> contain pages created as a result of user action. Data about the work done in the 
            selected thread.</li>
        <li><b>Data Pages :</b> contain read-only data pages defined by data page rules. Used to cache data from 
        another source (third-party service or SOR).</li>
        <li><b>Linked Property Pages :</b> list read-only pages created by related properties (advanced data 
        structures) which contain info about the data types referenced by an associated property.</li>
        <li><b>System Pages :</b> include pages that describe the current user session (active user, active app).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ex">
    Ex User Page : the data you enter in a form is stored on the pyWorkPage user page. <br>
    Ex Data Page : your app converts US $ to €. Exchange rates, determined by currency markets, are cached in a data 
    page for use by one or more users of the app. <br>
    Ex System Page : when a user is signed in to Pega, the platform maintains a clipboard page that contains info 
    about the user (ex : timezone).
    </p>

    <h3>pyWorkPage</h3>

    Viewing data on the clipboard can help identify bugs.
    <br>
    <b>pyWorkPage</b> stores data that is generated during case creation and processing. It is a specific page on the 
    clipboard and stores data (case creation date, case ID...). When you open a child case, the clipboard also 
    contains the page pyWorkCover that contains the case data for the parent case. Enables to copy data between the 2.
    <br> When configurating a rule that references a page, indicate the classe of the referenced page to allow Pega to 
    resolve references to rules within that class such as properties or else it may return an error.


    <h2>Data validation in Dev Studio</h2>
    For complex validation scenarios. <br>

    <b>Validate rules</b> ensure that the data that your users provide meets the conditions that a case requires in order 
    to go forward. By assigning validation rules to flow actions, you can prevent users from entering information that 
    your application cannot process and reduce the number of processing errors.
    In Dev Studio, you can extend validate rules that are created automatically in App Studio. You can also create new
    validate rules in the Process category. <br>
    <b>Edit validate</b> rules are typically applied to properties, and consist of Java code that compares the value of 
    a property to a defined pattern/required format, for example, if a value consists of seven numbers with a space 
    separating the 3rd and 4th number. If the input is wrong, the system warns the user. <br>
    <b>Business logic</b> for data format. Before an app can confirm if a phone number for instance, is valid, the app 
    must confirm that the user entry conforms to a specific format that may vary based on location. <br>
    <b>Validation qualification based on an input value</b> : validation logic with the <b>Input</b> tab of the validate 
    rule :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Input property :</b> Qualify validation based on data that is provided by the user.</li>
        <li><b>Proposed work status :</b> Qualify validation based on the status that the application applies to the 
            case.</li>
        <li><b>Flow action :</b> Qualify validation based on the action that is performed by a user.</li>
        <li><b>Stages :</b> Qualify validation based on the current stage of the case.</li>
    </ul>
    Library of <b>validation functions</b> on the validate rule form in Dev Studio. For instance, to check if a date falls 
    within 2 dates or if a user has attached a file. Each function presents a customized set of fields for configuring 
    validation behavior. <br>
    App explorer -- > case_type_name -- > create -- > process -- > validate


    <h2>Accessing sourced data in a case</h2>

    Au lieu de faire des allers-retours vers une database, on met une data page entre Pega et la database. Une page ou une 
    items list. Le scope détermine la visibilité d'une page au sein d'une application.<br>
    In Pega Platform™ applications, a data page retrieves data from a specified data source and caches that data in memory. 
    A data page manages the integration to the data source, separating business processes from any integration details. 
    This separation allows application developers to use sourced data in an application without knowing the data source and 
    connection details. Prefix D_ to data pages. 
    <ol>
        <li>A developer creates the data page</li>
        <li>A user request data from the data page</li>
        <li>The system checks the cached data in memory</li>
        <li>The system queries the data source for data if the data page is not in memory or is outdated</li>
        <li>The data source returns the requested data if necessary, filling in the data page</li>
        <li>Application presents the data to the user</li>
        <li>The user requests data from the data page again</li>
        <li>The application presents the cached data to the user</li>
    </ol>

    When creating a data page in Dev Studio, the developer must provide 4 pieces of information :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure</b> of the page contents : can contain one or many items. To access a specific 
            record within a structure list, use the syntax DataPageName.pxResults(index).</li>
        <li><b>Object type</b> represented by the contents of the data page</li>
        <li><b>Edit mode</b> supported by the page : <b>read-only, editable</b> or <b>savable</b> (updates the DB).</li>
        <li><b>Scope</b> of the data page : visibility of the page contents within the app (<b>Thread :</b> if the contents
         of a data page are unique to a single case. <b>Requestor :</b> if the contents of a data page are common to all of 
         the cases created by a single user or system. <b>Node :</b> if all users and system tasks on the system can share 
         the contents of a data page.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data sources</h3>
    used to specify how Pega populates the contents of a data page when an app references the page.
    To configure a data source for a data page : Data transform (return one or more itemps for a data view), Activity, 
    Connector, Report definition (return a list of item), Database lookup (return info about a single item), Robotic 
    automation, Robotic desktop automation. <br>

    <h4>Refresh strategies</h4>
    Out-of-date data — also referred to as <b>stale</b> data — can lead to bad decisions, costly errors, and inefficient 
    processes.
    Keeping the contents of a data page current is critical for ensuring accurate, desirable case outcomes -- > 
    configure a <u>refresh strategy</u> to identify and limit stale data. The refresh strategy for a data page defines one or
    more conditions for testing whether the contents of a data page are considered stale and need to be reloaded. If at least
    one condition is met, Pega reloads the page contents from the specified data source. <br><br>
    <b>Load management</b> tab : 3 options for configuring a refresh strategy for a read-only data page. <br><br>
    The <b>Reload once per interaction</b> option updates the contents of the data page each time a user accesses the page in 
    memory. Only for pages with the scope <b>Thread</b> or <b>Requestor</b>.
    <p class="ex">For example, travel reservation populates a data page with seating information for the flight selected by a 
    customer. Select Reload once per interaction to update the data page every time the customer accesses the page, to ensure 
    that the seating information is as current as possible.</p>

    The <b>Do not reload when</b> option uses a when condition to test whether the data page is considered stale. <br>
    The <b>Reload if older than</b> option uses a fixed interval of time to determine whether a data page is stale. The data 
    page is refreshed when the next request for the page occurs after the interval ended. <br>

    <h3>Page autopopulation</h3>

    <b>Refer to the data page</b> when you always need the most current data from an external system or application. Not a 
    copy, refers to the data from the source. The data reloads according to the refresh strategy specified on the data page.
    Whenever a data page parameter is updated, a new data page is created. (ex : D_Customer) <br>
    <b>Copy data from a data page</b> to a case when you need data from a specific point in time. The data is stored in the
    property. Once you copy the data to the case, the data is not retrieved from the source again unless the request 
    parameters change and so, a new data page is created. (Also referred to as a snapshot.)  <br> <br>
    When you populate a list with data from a data page, only the selected value is copied to the data model of a case.

    <b>Simulated external data sources</b> : useful when the external system is unavailable. To develop and test. When you 
    know the response data, it helps to unit test the implementation.


    <h2>Savable data pages</h2>

    Used to save a page or page list of data specified in a data page back to its SOR (Pega or external database) -- > 
    an application can update the SOR in real-timr with case data.
    <p class="ex">Ex : A company uses an external database as an SOR. An HR assigns an employee an unoccupied office. 
        When submitted, the application updates the record for the seating location in the SOR with the employee ID to 
        prevent another user from selecting the same. (Read from SOR - Edit - Save to SOR).
    </p>

    <b>Data save plan :</b> details how saves are performed. Specified in the data save options section. Can be multiple
    with When rule. (Database save, Activity, Connector, Robotic automation, and Robotic desktop automation). 
    Can be triggered in 3 ways : Add a Save data page automation step in a flow rule. Add post-processing for a flow action 
    rule. Call the Save-DataPage method in an activity rule.<br>
    <b>Transaction handling</b> : by using savable data pages, you can write data to the SOR using Pega Platform's built-in 
    transaction handling.  For example, the payment and payment notification is performed in the same transaction,
    so it prevents from this situation : the bank processes the payment but the user does not receive the notification 
    due to network issue.

    <p>
    - Data page task : Updating data instance. Is a key value present ? Yes. Source : Lookup. <br>
    - Data page task : Creating data instance. Is a key value present ? No. Source : Data transform.</p>

    The <b>Database save</b> option maintains transactionality within the save operation when data is saved and 
    writes a single instance back to a database table in a system of record (SOR).

    Add a <b>Save data page</b> automation step to identify when Pega updates the SOR during the case. Two options for 
    specifying a savable data page : explicitly in the <b>Data Page Name</b> field or reference with <b>Use associated
    property</b> option.


    <h2>Field values</h2>
    
    Need to use a list of allowed values for a specific property. If the list is short, mostly static, does not require 
    localization, and common across inherited classes, the list may be defined in a local list on the property record.
    If the list of allowed values is large, expected to change frequently, requires localization, or requires customization 
    at the class level, you can use a <b>field value.</b> (if very large, database table). It provides an alternate method 
    for defining allowed values for properties. Managing the allowed values separately from the property enables you to 
    reuse a single property and customize the allowed values based on the context of the property. <br>
    You can add different field values for a single property in the same context or in separate contexts using the Apply 
    to class setting for each value. You can also use rulesets to maintain different versions of each field value in each 
    context.

    <h2>Configuration sets</h2>

    Configuration settings provide developers with a unified framework for customizing parameters for application behavior.
    Can be used in three ways :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Control the use of features in an application</b> - When a feature has dependencies, you can use Configuration 
            settings to turn features off until the dependencies are met. </li>
        <li><b>Determine which process in a flow should be followed</b></li>
        <li><b>Control UI experience</b></li>
    </ul>
    Configuration sets are created and maintained in App Studio to group Configuration settings. Rules such as classes, 
    data pages, and properties are created when developing Configuration sets in App Studio and are visible in Dev Studio.
    Defined in the Pega-Configuration class structure. <br>
    You can use Configuration settings to change components of a flow that may change as business needs change. <br>
    Configuration settings are included when the Include associated data check box is selected.
    The Condition Builder provides a menu to select a configuration set and Configuration setting. 
    <br>
    Administrators can read/write/delete configuration sets and configuration settings. Users can only read. Managers can 
    read/write.
