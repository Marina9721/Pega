    <h1 class="title">Journey configurations</h1>

    A journey is a customer interaction. It is split into smaller pieces called microjourneys.

    Deliver one goal at a time. To deliver an MLP release (Minimum Lovable Product = value-added solution
    that addresses a business need or pain point and is a quick deliverable) we focus on 3 core elements (in App Studio) :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Microjourneys :</b> small part of the journey that focuses on one specific goal (request/results) </li>
        <li><b>Personas and chanels : </b> people who interacts with the application (customer or company employee)
            + how a persona interact with the application (web portal or chatbot).</li>
        <li><b>Data and interfaces : </b> info that the microjourney interacts with to accomplish the goal + 
        defines where the data comes from or where it is persisted. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cases</h2>

    <h3>Case type : </h3> abstract model of a business transaction (repeatable).

    <h3>Case : </h3> specific transaction instance, is assigned a number. Collection of data.

    <h3>Case life cycle : </h3> business model of the micro journey that can be defined in smaller 
    modules. It models the path the case follows to resolution. The application functions the same way that users 
    think about and describe their work, it helps visualize the work that must be completed.
    For example an online order process : submit order + process order + deliver order.
    The work is organized into <u>stages</u>.

    <h4>Stage : </h4> it represents the case transfer from one caseworker to another (transfer of authority) or change in the 
    <u>case status</u> ( = progress of a case towards resolution - updates at the beginning of the step).
    <p class="ex">Ex : in an online order, customers place order, warehouse employees process order, 
        shipping service employees deliver order => three stages : Submission, Processing, Delivery. </p>
    Naming convention : a noun or noun phrase, meaningful and relevant. <br>
    Stages are divided in processes that are divided in steps. Naming convention : 2 words max, verb+noun

    The first stage is the Create stage (green bar) and contains processes and steps for users to enter initial data.
    It cannot be deleted. <br>
    Primary stages are stages that lead to an expected outcome. The majority of cases should go through them. 
    Usual case processing. <br>
    The resolution stage (red bar) is the last stage, it defines the case behavior at the end of the case life cycle. <br>
    We can create parallel processes that can be done in parallel with no priority. <br>

    Alternate stages are stages that handle deviations from the primary path in case of an approve/reject step. 
    They represent a negative resolution stage or exceptions to the normal course of events or are used for exception handling 
    to reenter the primary path when the exception is handled. They can be sequenced into primary stages. <br>
    Automation steps are performed by the system (ex : change stage to re enter the primary path) but this stage must be added, 
    alternate stages cannot be configured to change step automatically.
    <br> <br>
    You can configure the stage transition in the property panel :
    <ul>
        <li>Automatically move to the next stage when all steps are complete</li>
        <li>Wait for a user action</li>
        <li>Resolve the case when all processes are complete (for the last one generally)</li>
    </ul>
    or with a Change stage step. <br>
    Not more than 10 primary stages and 5 alternate stages per case.

    <h3>Optional actions </h3>
    Different from alternate stages : actions that users optionally perform, it is not part of the normal course of events. 
    It can be a process divided in multiple steps or a user action if it one step only.
    It can be an optional Change Stage action that may be called at any time during case processing.

    <p class="ex">Ex 1 : while reporting a car accident to an insurance company, the customer mentions having a new phone
         number. The agent launches the Update Customer optional user action on a single screen. It returns to the primary 
         path then. Ex 2 : In case of an order cancellation, the Cancel Order optional process is launched and the case is 
         Resolved. Ex 3 : a user transfer the case to another employee at any stage of the case.
    </p>

    In the case designer, "Optional actions". Two possibilities : <u>case wide actions</u>, the optional action can be 
    launched at any time during the case (1st example) or <u>stage-only actions</u>, the optional action can be launched 
    from a specific stage only (2nd example).

    <h3>Conditional execution</h3>
    We can define whether a process or stage runs in a case or is skipped. Field + comparator + value. By default, a stage 
    or a process always starts. In the configuration pane, a condition must be entered to skip. It have several conditions.

    <p class="ex">Ex : Automobile accident case : was a party injured ? if yes, the File personal injury claim is ran, 
        if no, that process is skipped.
    </p>

    <h3>Case status</h3>
    Indicates the progress of a case towards resolution (for stages or steps). Prefixes : New, Open, Pending, Resolved. 
    Suffixes : Pending-Approval, Pending-Fulfillment.
    Closed cases should use Resolved (-Completed, -Withdrawn, -Cancelled).
    <p class="ex">Ex : stages of an online shopping application. New order = New, Processing = Pending-Processing, 
        Fulfillment = Pending-Fulfillment, Shipping = Resolved-Completed. <br>
        In the Shipping stage, there are two steps : status = Pending-Shipping and status = Pending-Arrival
    </p>

    <h3>Duplicate cases </h3>
    To check if a case is duplicated, Pega provides a search system : Search duplicate cases step. The system uses basic 
    and weighted conditions to compare specific property values with existing cases. The basic condition is the reference, 
    the weighted conditions are the conditions that will differentiate the case from others and are assigned a weight.
    If there is a duplicate, the user can resolve the case with the Resolved-Duplicate status.

    <p class="ex">Health care services application : the patient date of birth is the basic condition, the surgeon name, 
        surgical type, procedure and date are weighted conditions with a value of 25 each and a threshold of 50. The system 
        finds a duplicate beacause everything matches so the total weighted condition value is 100, exceeding the threshold 50.
        It can be resolved as Resolved-Duplicate or Ignore & Continue.
    </p>

    <b>User guidance :</b> add instructions in assignments to be sure the user knows what to enter. Most useful in 
    Collect information steps.

    <h2>Child cases (extended)</h2>

    A case can require other cases. Adding a child case can be considered when additional information is needed to complete the 
    parent case and that information can be obtained through a separate process. Case relationships can be modeled with a 
    hierarchy of top-level cases (cases that do not have a parent case but can become a parent for other cases) and child cases. 
    The work can be done in parallel by different parties. The child cases must all be resolved before the parent case can be 
    resolved. Child cases are beneficial when you want to model work that different parties perform, that follows different 
    reporting options and time frames and that is common to multiple case types. <br>
    Data propagation : you can specify the information to copy from the parent case to the child case (if data does not change).
    Reference the data in the parent case if the data might change in the parent case to keep the info synchronized (from child 
    case to parent case).<br>
    In Pega, add a Create Case automation step to the case life cycle.

    <p class="ex">Ex : the Accident Claim case needs to generate Vehicle Damage and Body Injury cases if necessary.</p>

    <h2>Routing assignments to a user or a group of users :</h2>
    
    increases business efficiency by assigning work to the most appropriate parties. Can be done in the configuration pane.
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>current user :</b> if the user who completed the preceding assignment needs to complete the current task.</li>
        <li><b>worklist (specific user) :</b> the assignment must be completed by a specific user. The worklist is a list of 
            assignments, in order of importance, that must be completed by a specific user.</li>
        <li><b>work queue :</b> list of tasks, in order of importance, that can be done by several users in a same <u>work 
            group</u>, to distribute work.</li>
        <li><b>business logic :</b> assign tasks based on certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Approvance</h3>

    Configure routing to define who is assigned to the approval and configure the flow to define how the case proceeds if it is 
    approved or rejected. The email or mobile approval option can be enabled to send notifications to the assigned user. <br>
    Approvals generally continue the case but it can be configured to change to a specific case and the status too for example. 
    By default, rejected steps are set to Resolved-Rejected.
