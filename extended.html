    <h2>Agile methodology</h2>
    Agile development supports a customer's need to update their production environment as business needs change. Enables 
    frequent and small changes.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Real-time updates:</b> frequent development iterations that are small in scope</li>
        <li><b>Testing:</b> continuous application validation to identify and address issues early</li>
        <li><b>Branches:</b> concurrent team development environment to maximize productivity</li>
    </ul>
     
 
    <h2>Agile workbench</h2>
    Software tool to track feature development and capture real-time project feedback. Supports Directly Capture Objectives
    (DCO) and agile development. 

    In the Application profile, we can add new features.
    The Developer Assistant pane helps to organize work by using AI-powered developer aids. We can access all the 
    tasks to be completed before the application goes into production. Four tabs : 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Guidance</b> contains suggestions to improve the app. Guidelines and best practices for the successful 
        design and implementation of your application.</li>
        <li><b>Knowledge</b> contains content that is relevant to the most recent action</li>
        <li><b>Work</b> to access Agile Workbench with feedback and development status of the app's features</li>
        <li><b>Checklists</b> access application guides such as Security checklist</li>
    </ul>
    
    <u>features</u> : capabilities that you want your application to support. <br>
    <u>subfeatures</u> : features within a feature. both can be linked to user stories. <br>
    Work items = backlog of development work. Every work item has a status (<b>To do</b>, <b>Doing</b>, <b>Done</b>)
    <ul>
        <li><b>User stories : </b>business requirements</li>
        <li><b>Bugs</b> to document feature defects</li>
        <li><b>Feedback</b> to record enhancement requests. Used to guide development on current or future releases</li>
    </ul>
    Agile workbench provides continuous access to work item status and new work item creation.
    Interfaces with Agile Studio that expands the Agile Workbench functionality with more robust features for release 
    management, progress tracking, team capacity and analytics. Also with Jira or CA Agile Central.


    <h4>DevOps</h4>
    Set of practices that bridge application development and operational behavior to reduce time to market without compromising 
    on quality and operational effectiveness. Allows app dev and business owners to respond to customer needs quickly, develop a 
    quicker feedback cycle and achieve business value faster. Three components :
    <ul>
        <li><b>People :</b> encourages collaboration between development, quality and operation teams to reduce barriers through 
        continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment.</li>
        <li><b>Process :</b> encourages an automated process to quickly move apps from development through testing to 
        deployment.</li>
        <li><b>Technology :</b> encourages model-driven and open solutions to build a deployment pipeline.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Two key stages of software delivery :</b> <br>
    <b>Continuous integration : </b> app dev frequently check in changes to the source environment and use an automated build 
    process to verify these changes automatically. Continuously validate and merge code. Add "ready to share" and "integrate changes" 
    steps in the pipeline to ensure that all necessary critical tests are run before integrating and publishing changes to a development 
    repository. 
    <b>==> Test early and often, Automate, Update rules, Maintain version history</b>
    <br>
    <b>Continuous delivery : </b> application changes run through rigorous automated regression testing. The changes are 
    deployed to a staging environment for further testing to ensure that the app is ready to deploy on the production system.
    In a 'ready to accept' step, testing runs to ensure that the acceptance criteria are met. A 'ready to deploy' step verifies all 
    the necessary performance, scale, and compatibility tests that are necessary to ensure that the application is ready for deployment.
    The deploy step validates in a preproduction environment, deploys to production, and runs post-deployment tests.
    <b>==> Create test environments, Conduct regression tests, Use version control, Employ a rollback strategy, Document</b>
    <br>
    DevOps involves both business and technical team members in continuous integration and delivery. <br>
    <b>The Deployment Manager</b> : pipeline manager, used to move your app from environment to environment. (App + Admin studio)

    <h3>Pega Express Delivery</h3>
    Agile methodology tailored to application development using Pega Platform. Four phases :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Discover :</b> Define your business outcomes and create a Day 1 Go-Live plan</li>
        <li><b>Prepare :</b> Host a design sprint with end users to build a working prototype</li>
        <li><b>Build :</b> Build your application based on user stories in the backlog</li>
        <li><b>Adopt :</b> Once your application goes live, conduct a release retrospective</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roles in PEGA project</h2>
    <a href="roles.html">Roles in Pega</a>


    <h2>Decision points and automation shapes</h2>

    Automated decisions based on business logic allows application users to focus on decisions that require human expertise. <br>
    We can model complex case life cycles that require branching or skipping a step.
    <br>
    <b>Flow :</b> sequence of events that models a business process, to support the different paths that users can take through 
    a case life cycle. Graphical shapes depending on the type of decision and connectors. Easier to visualize. <br>
    Decision shapes can be used to add a conditional path to a flow or model more complex use cases. An automated decision evaluates 
    business logic or a set of one or more conditions.
    <p class="ex">Assignment -- > Decision shape : is this condition satisified ? -- > if yes : Subprocess -- > if no : Assignment 
        -- > end shape</p>

    <p> Pega provides automations to perform specific actions automatically, for example to send an email. Saves development time and 
    enables you to design business processes more efficiently. <br>
    In Pega : Step - More - Automations -> Attach content, Change to a stage, Create case, Create PDF, Send email... </p>
    <b>Run data transform</b> automation helps to run the selected data transform rule at run time.


    <h2>Case workflow dependency (pausing and resuming case processing)</h2>

    Use of the Wait step to enforce dependencies (to pause and resume case processing). Two wait types :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Case Dependency :</b> pauses case processing of a parent case until the child case dependency resolves.
        Add a Wait step to the parent case : the cases pauses until all child cases reach a defined status or resolve.</li>
        <li><b>Timer :</b> pauses a case until the <b>Set date/time interval</b> expires or until a <b>Reference date/time</b> 
            is reached.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Data validation</h2>

    Data requirements : data must be the right type, must be restricted to possible values, must fit the business logic...
    <p class="ex">Ex : use a calendar to ensure that the data entered by users is a date. But to ensure that the date is in the past, 
        we use business logic.
    </p>
    Creation of conditions that define invalid data values so that an error message is displayed for the user when the condition is met
    (error message guideline + validation condition configuration). The system prevents the user from continuing the case until they 
    submit valid data (on a form for instance). To display messages -- > Configure view in the property pane -- > Validations <br>
    Validation on a stage : manage all stage entry validations for a specific case type in one convenient place.


    <h2>Explore Data</h2>

    <b>Explore Data</b> <u>landing page (cf portal content)</u> : explore and analyze your application data quickly (query : sort, filter, 
    group results). 
    Queries can be saved as <u><b>insights</b></u> = rules that Pega uses to transform data queries into tables or visualizations 
    that you can share between users (list or interactive chart). You select the type of data (Case Type, Data Object...).
    Custom data query can be displayed in a table-based insight or can be visualized in a chart-based insight or simple value chart.

    <p class="ex">Nombre de commandes contenant tel article, list of assignments that are routed to members of your team, claims 
        that are pending approval...
    </p>

    <b>Report Browser</b> tool to create new reports, organize, run, share reports, manage report categories. A <u>category</u> defines 
    an organization framework for reports displayed in the Report Browser = label + owner type (private or public).
    <br>
    <b>Business metrics</b> measure the success or failure of business processes, based on data you define for an application.
     -- > to make informed decisions about improving business performance.
    <br>
    <b>Process metrics</b> measure how work is performed, based on data automatically collected by Pega Platform.
     -- > enables business analysts and business managers to discover issue that impact process efficiency.


    <h2>UI elements</h2>

    User interface elements (text inputs, layouts) present information and actionable items on the user interface. In Pega :
    Autocomplete controls, buttons, charts, check boxes, drop-down lists, links, sliders, text area/rich-text editors (inputs).
    Out-of-the-box UI elements come with predefined style formats : saves development time, reduces maintenance work, improves 
    consistency of the application's look and feel. Can style typography, borders, backgrounds, layouts, placement, alignment. 
    For example, the predefined formats for a button include Standard, Simple and Strong. <br>
    Avoid using drop-down control for long lists : autocomplete control. <br>
    Links : to redirect users to a webpage. Buttons : to invoke an action when clicked or to display a cascading menu.

    <h3>Dynamic functionality on UI elements</h3>

    Designing elements on a UI to adapt according to user input. We configure when UI elements are visible, disabled, required.
    == > real-time response to end-user behavior, robust functionality available for most user interactions, reduced visual clutter 
    on the screen, fewer full-page refreshes, which improves UI responsiveness.
    <p class="ex">Ex : in a loan request, customers specify their marital status by selecting "single" or "married". If "married" is 
    selected, the app displays user entry fields for their spouse. </p>

    <h3>Event and action sets</h3>

    <b>Event :</b> a trigger caused by user activity (button click, field entry...). <b>Action :</b> a response by the application 
    (creating a case, displaying information about a field to guide user input).
    <p class="ex">ex : If the shipping address is the same as the billing address, the user can select a check box for the application 
        to copy the shipping address information to the billing address fields and disable any editing of the billing address. </p>

    <b>Examples of event-action pairs :</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Click a control (button, link, icon) : open a new window</li>
        <li>Double-click a row in the grid : allow editing of the contents of the row</li>
        <li>press the Enter key on the keyboard : display a menu</li>
        <li>Select a value from a list of states or provinces : update the list of office locations</li>
        <li>Enter a value in the Quantity field : verify that inventory is sufficient to fulfill the order</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Action set :</b> one or more events and one or more actions. To configure an actionable control. Can add conditions.
    One or more events can trigger an action and an event can trigger more than one set of actions.
    <br>
    Refresh when property values are updated on the server and the UI needs to reflect the new values, when an action that causes a change
    must be submitted.
    Refresh When action for read-only references that need to remain synchronized with data on the server.
    <p class="ex">Ex : End users can clear selections on a form and view the previous actions on the case. 
        To configure the action set on a button to achieve this result : 
        First, configure a Click event with a Refresh action. Next, add a View History action to the event. </p>


    <h2>Decision tables</h2>

    A decision table consists of a table of conditions and results. You define set of conditions (property values that must fall within a 
    certain range) and the results to return when the conditions are true. Each set of conditions contains a corresponding result. 
    Do not forget the otherwise if none of the conditions are true to always return a result.
    <br>
    Yes/no question when using an automated decision process -- > a When rule serves the purpose. <br>
    Test the values of multiple properties to answer questions - > Decision table (can return results other than true or false).
    <p class="ex">Does this purchase order require additional approval ? yes or no. <br>
    What promotional offer should the company offer ? decision table : if customer history >=5, 20OFFON50. 
    if customer history >5, 15OFFON100</p>

    A condition uses an equal or greater than or less than comparison operators. When the system evaluates a decision table, it starts 
    with the top row and evaluates each condition in the row. If all of the conditions of a row are true, the system returns the result 
    for that row and stop processing.
    <p class="ex">a YPlus cargo courier company charges a USD500 delivery charge for courier services. YPlus has decided to update the 
    delivery charge calculation based on distance. Suppose the delivery address is within 100 miles. In that case, the delivery charge 
    is USD50. If the address is within 500 miles, the delivery charge is USD100. If the address is within 1000 miles, the delivery charge 
    is USD250, and if the delivery address is farther than 1000 miles, the delivery charge is USD500. <br>
    Conditions : Distance <= <br>
    100 -- > return 50 <br>
    500 -- > return 100 <br>
    1000 -- > return 250
    Otherwise -- > 500 <br>
    No need to do : if distance < 500 AND distance > 100 because the conditions are checked row by row.
</p>


<h2>Portal content</h2>
A <b>Portal</b> is the user interface of an application. It consists of <b>landing pages</b> that consolidate case-related information 
within the application (list of landing pages in the main menu). A portal is a web channel in use by your app, accessed through a browser. 
Used to design custom web interfaces for personas that provide them with the info and functionalities they need. 
By default in Pega : User Portal, with a standard UI for working on cases.

<h3>Landing pages</h3>

<p><b>Landing pages</b> are used to display specific information in menus of the application. Present fields, controls and resources 
to users as images and texts. (create, configure, add). Landing pages added to a portal menu are also added to the portal.
Customize the main menu and improve navigation and UX. <br>
<b>Custom pages =</b> out-of-the-box landing pages. For example, Teams is a custom page that displays the teams the user belongs to.</p>
Manage access to landing pages by specifying visibility by role. Disable an existing landing page no longer needed so it can't be added 
to a menu. Add landing page to organize the content of the channel in a main menu.

<h3>Dashboards</h3>
A dashboard is a landing page that is accessed by a user in their portal. It consists of widgets (elements of the UI that display info 
about the app and KPI) that consolidate summary info and key performance indicators (KPI). Contains the info necessary for a particular 
role to help increase productivity. By default, dashboards are tailored to a role (user by default). It can be personalized and it won't 
affect others' dashboards.<br>
A template defines the layout of a dashboard and divides the workspace into slots (containers for one or more widgets).

<h3>Channels</h3>

Examples of a channel : messaging service, voice service, web portal or mobile portal. A channel interface allows us to adjust our 
application to our specific business needs by creating tailored and interactive UI. Created from templates.  <br>
Conversational channels : app users can interact with a Pega Platform app to obtain help by using Messenger, WhatsApp, Twitter, Apple 
Business Chat, Twilio, Embedded chat window, Alexa, Email. <br>
<b>Pega Intelligent Virtual Assistant, Pega Email Bot, Pega Marketplace</b>. <br>

Types of channels we can create on Pega : Portal, Web mashup Mobile, Digital Messaging, Email, Alexa. <br>

The Channels and interfaces landing page allows you to create, view, and edit all types of channel interfaces. You can add a 
channel-specific process on the Create stage with the More icon. It must be added to the app before.
<p class="ex">
    Ex : You can add a channel process so that when users enter a specific command in Messenger a case opens in your application.</p>

<h3>Mobile app channels</h3>
IOS + Android <br>

A mobile channel provides developers a way to intuitively configure and customize various aspects of mobile app behavior. 
Can use the existing mobile channel (Content, Configuration, Layout, Manage). Content tab to customize app navigation (mobile app pages),
define swipe actions.
The channel provides a real-time preview of the app design when interface being customized (colors, icons, buttons). <br>
Security configuration : require login on mobile app, disable access on mobile app, lock app after x minutes...

<h2>Collaboration tools</h2>
From App studio and Dev studio :
<ul>
    <li><b>Pulse :</b> out-of-the-box messaging system for Pega, to post messages to specific individuals or a team. 
        Access with the Toggle developer collaboration icon for app dev, by the nav bar for app users.</li>
    <li><b>Spaces :</b> digital format for gathering users that have a single, common interest. To unify single digital community. 
        Share documents, notif.</li>
    <li><b>Documents :</b> to collaborate on and share artifacts. Users don't need to leave the app to access externally-stored content. 
        To associate documents with a specific case, create the document in the Utility pane; with a specific space -- > in that space. 
        The system can create case documents as part of the case life cycle -- > Generate documents automation step.</li>
</ul>
Users can receive notifications when someone references a user in a Pulse message or comments a post they commented... Can respond 
directly from the email notification.
