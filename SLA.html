    <h1>Service-level agreement</h1>

    Establishes a work completion deadline, to enforce on-time performance.
    Beneficial to delay processing a SLA to account for assignments that are not immediately ready for users.
    SLA can be configured on case types, stages, processes and Collect information and Approval steps. <br>
    The goal defines how long the assignment should take (from when the assignment started). The deadline defines 
    the longest amount of time the assignment may take before it is considered "late".


    In PEGA, we can use the <b>Assignment Ready</b> field. <br>
    <ul>
        <li> <u>Immediately</u> : assignment is immediately ready and users can begin work immediately</li>
        <li> <u>Dynamically defined on a property</u> : use of a DateTime property value defined to determine when users 
            are expected to start work on assignments </li>
        <li> <u>Timed delay</u> : to start the assignment after a period of time (days, hours, minutes)</li> 
    </ul>  

    <h1>Assignment emergency</h1>

    Numeric value ranging from 0 to 100 that brings visibility to unresolved work (to cases or assignments).
    It is used in GetNextWork selection algorithm to identify the next assignment a user should work on.
    The urgency increases by a defined value when the goal is reached. <u>Escalation actions</u> : Notifications can be sent 
    to the assignee or the assignment can be tranferred to someone else or the case can be solved as goals or deadlines 
    occur. By default, case urgency is 10.
    <p class="ex">Employees must submit a timesheet within 2 business days but no later than three business days. <br>
         Start (0 hours) : +0. Goal (48 hours) : +10. Deadline (72 hours) : +10. <br>
